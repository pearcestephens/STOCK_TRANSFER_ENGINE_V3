## 🎯 **CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES DISCOVERED**

### **Transfer Settings Reality**
- **99.9% of products** have NO custom settings (use system defaults)
- **System defaults are INTELLIGENT** - no artificial limits unless business-justified
- **Sparse overrides** only for problem products requiring manual intervention
- **Algorithm decides** optimal quantities based on stock levels and demand

### **Pack Rules Intelligence**
- **Hierarchy matters** - Product > Category > System defaults
- **Enforce vs Suggest** - Some packs MUST be enforced, others are just preferred
- **Rounding modes** - Floor/Ceil/Round depending on business requirements
- **GPT fills gaps** - AI categorization for new/unknown products

### **Weight Optimization Discovery**
```
Heavy Items (300g+): Starter kits, mod kits - Ship fewer, higher value
Medium Items (50-200g): Disposables, e-liquids - Balance quantity vs cost  
Light Items (<50g): Coils, accessories - Ship more units efficiently
```

### **Product Type Intelligence**
```
disposable     → 10 units seed (high turnover, 60g each)
starter_kit    → 5 units seed (moderate turnover, 300g each)  
mod_kit       → 2 units seed (low turnover, 400g each)
e-liquid      → 5 units seed (steady demand, 150g each)
coils_pods    → 10 units seed (consumables, 40g each)
accessory     → 5 units seed (steady demand, 80g each)
batteries     → 10 units seed (consumables, 60g each)
unknown       → 3 units seed (conservative approach, 100g each)
```
