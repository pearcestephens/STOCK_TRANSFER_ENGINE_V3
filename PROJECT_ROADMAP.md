## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Database Integration Strategy**
```php
// Priority database connections and optimization
1. vend_products_outlet_transfer_settings (sparse overrides)
2. vend_products_default_transfer_settings (product rules)  
3. pack_rules (product/category hierarchy)
4. category_pack_rules (category defaults)
5. category_weights (shipping optimization)
6. product_types (seeding intelligence)
7. product_classification_unified (AI integration)
8. vend_inventory (real-time stock levels)
```

### **Algorithm Implementation Order**
```php
1. Transfer Settings Cascade → getTransferSettingsWithFallback()
2. Pack Rules Resolution → getPackRulesCascade()
